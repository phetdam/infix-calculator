Intended as a hands-on project to get familiar with Flex_ and Bison_.

TBD. Currently imagined as using a REPL-style interface.

Maybe in the future I will be able to support name assignment.

TBD, but requires CMake_ >=3.16. For now, please follow the instructions in the
top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``.
